<!-- Getting Started
This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the first ten weeks of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

Your application should use Jest (Links to an external site.) for running the unit tests and Inquirer (Links to an external site.) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

node index.js
It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like this:

.
├── __tests__/             //jest tests
│   ├── Employee.test.js
│   ├── Engineer.test.js
│   ├── Intern.test.js
│   └── Manager.test.js
├── dist/                  // rendered output (HTML) and CSS style sheet      
├── lib/                   // classes
├── src/                   // template helper code 
├── .gitignore             // indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js               // runs the application
└── package.json           
IMPORTANT
Make sure that you remove dist from the .gitignore file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.

The application must have these classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must all pass.

The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:

name

id

email

getName()

getId()

getEmail()

getRole() // Returns 'Employee'

The other three classes will extend Employee.

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have:

officeNumber

getRole() // Overridden to return 'Manager'

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have:

github // GitHub username

getGithub()

getRole() // Overridden to return 'Engineer'

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have:

school

getSchool()

getRole() // Overridden to return 'Intern'

Finally, although it’s not a requirement, you should consider adding validation to ensure that user input provided is in the proper expected format. -->
